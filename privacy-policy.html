<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 October 2025</p>

<p>Kingzdata (“we”, “our”, “us”) provides a mobile app that lets users buy mobile data and airtime (“the App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use the App.</p>

  <li><strong>Transaction Details</strong>: mobile network, recipient number, bundle/amount, timestamps, and status.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Information</strong>: processed securely by our payment processor; we do not store card numbers. We receive payment confirmations and references.</li>
  <li><strong>Device & App Info</strong>: app version, device model/OS, and diagnostics/logs to improve reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Process purchases of data and airtime and deliver receipts/status updates.</li>
  <li>Provide customer support and resolve disputes.</li>
  <li>Prevent fraud, secure our services, and comply with legal obligations.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>

</ul>

<h2>Payments</h2>
<p>All payments are handled by our third-party payment processor. Your card details are transmitted directly to the processor over encrypted connections and are not stored on our servers. We receive payment confirmations (e.g., transaction reference) to complete your order.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We keep transaction records and related information for as long as needed to provide the service, comply with our legal/accounting obligations, and resolve disputes. Where retention is no longer necessary, we delete or anonymize data.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use technical and organizational measures to protect information, including encryption in transit, access controls, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can view your recent transactions in the App.</li>
  <li>You can contact us to correct or delete personal information we hold about you, subject to legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Account & Data Deletion</h2>
<p>If the App includes an account: you can request deletion by contacting us at <a href="mailto:[YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]">[YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]</a> or via the in-app help. If the App does not create accounts, you can still request deletion of personal information we hold (e.g., contact details) at the same address. We will verify your request and respond within a reasonable time.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>
<p>Kingzdata is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided us personal information, contact us to remove it.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed in countries different from where you live. Where required, we use safeguards to protect your information.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will change the “Last updated” date above and, where appropriate, provide additional notice in the App.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Questions or requests? Email us at <a href="mailto:[YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]">[YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]</a> or write to: [YOUR LEGAL/BUSINESS NAME], [ADDRESS].</p>
