<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 15 October 2025</p>

<p>Kingzdata (“Kingzdata”, “we”, “us”, “our”) provides a mobile application that lets users buy mobile data and airtime (“App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect information when you use the App.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information</strong>: If you create an account, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and password (stored in hashed form).</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Information</strong>: Network operator, recipient phone number, bundle/amount, references, timestamps, and status (success/failed/refunded).</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Information</strong>: Payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., PalmPay, OPay, and participating Payment Service Banks). We do not store card or bank account numbers on our servers. We receive payment confirmations (e.g., transaction reference) to complete your order.</li>
  <li><strong>Device & App Data</strong>: Device model and OS version, app version, performance logs and diagnostics used to secure and improve the App.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Provide and operate the App, including processing data/airtime purchases and sending receipts and order updates.</li>
  <li>Authenticate users, maintain accounts, and provide customer support.</li>
  <li>Detect, prevent, and investigate fraud, abuse, or security incidents.</li>
  <li>Comply with legal, regulatory, and accounting obligations.</li>
  <li>Analyze performance and improve features and reliability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
<p>We may share information with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Payment Processors</strong> (e.g., PalmPay, OPay, and Payment Service Banks) to process payments. Your sensitive payment details are handled by these providers.</li>
  <li><strong>Telecom/network service partners</strong> to fulfill top-ups and resolve delivery issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Service Providers</strong> that host infrastructure, analytics, customer support, or other services under contracts that protect your data.</li>
  <li><strong>Authorities</strong> if required by law or to protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We retain account and transaction records for as long as needed to provide the service and meet legal and accounting obligations. When retention is no longer required, we delete or anonymize data.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>We use administrative, technical, and organizational measures to protect information, including encryption in transit, restricted access, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

<h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You can view recent transactions in the App.</li>
  <li>You can update certain account details in the App or by contacting us.</li>
  <li>You can request deletion of your account and personal information (see below).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Account & Data Deletion</h2>
<p>You may request account deletion or deletion of personal information by emailing <a href="mailto:kingssub1401@gmail.com">kingssub1401@gmail.com</a> or through in-app support. We may retain certain records where required by law (e.g., transaction records for accounting or fraud prevention) and will delete the rest within a reasonable period.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>

<h2>International Transfers</h2>
<p>Your information may be processed in countries different from where you live. Where required, we use safeguards to protect your information.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the “Last updated” date and may provide additional notice in the App.</p>
